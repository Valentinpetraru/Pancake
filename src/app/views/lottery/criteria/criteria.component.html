  <div class="paragraph">Here’s an example lottery draw, with two tickets, A and B.</div>

  <div class="list">
    <ul>
      <li>Ticket A: The first 3 digits and the last 2 digits match, but the 4th digit is wrong, so this ticket only wins a “Match
      first 3” prize.</li>
      <li>Ticket B: Even though the last 5 digits match, the first digit is wrong, so this ticket doesn’t win a prize.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="last">
    Prize brackets don’t ‘stack’: if you match the first 3 digits in order, you’ll only win prizes from the ‘Match 3’
    bracket, and not from ‘Match 1’ and ‘Match 2’.
